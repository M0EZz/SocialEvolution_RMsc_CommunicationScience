The Social Evolution experiment covers the locations, proximities, and phone calls of more than 80% of residents who lived in a student dormitory, as captured by their cell phones from October 2008 to May 2009. This dormitory has a population of approximately 30 freshmen, 20 sophomores, 10 juniors, 10 seniors and 10 graduate student tutors. The experiment was designed to study the adoption of diet, exercise, obesity, eating habits, epidemiological contagion, depression and stress, dorm political issues, interpersonal relationships, and privacy.

Data collection includes proximity (Proximity.csv) and call log (Calls.csv and SMS.csv) data, collected through a cell-phone application that scans nearby Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth devices every six minutes. Survey data includes relationships (RelationshipsFromSurveys.csv), health behaviour (Health.csv including food, drinking, smoking, exercise), current health and anxiety level (FluSymptoms.csv), music sharing (MusicGenreAwareness.csv, MusicGenreImmersion.csv, MusicGenrePreference.csv), and some basic personal information (Subjects.csv).
